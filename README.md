# Heading-Helper

Quickly generate vertical rhythm by using a modular type scale, grid, and auto-layout. Preview ATX headings using “#”

Like this:
# Heading 1
Lorem Ipsum
 
##### Heading 5
It goes up to Heading 5
 
 
# What is vertical rhythm
 
## Modular type scales
Modular type scales in typography are used to generate visual rhythm and also hierarchically define what to look at first. 
 
## Vertical rhythm
Vertical rhythm is used to keep vertical spaces consistent. In print there is a baseline that text sit on. On the web it sits in the middle. 
 
# What can I do here?
 
This plugin lets you generate a modular scale and a line-height to make sure everything fits on a grid using Auto-Layout. You can also put in a margin component to give spacing where it is needed. These margin components and the line-height of each text generated creates consistent vertical spacing that fits on the grid. 
 
1. Set a base-size
2. Set a multiplier
3. Set a line-height
4. Choose to generate styles or not (give the folder a name to stay organized!)
5. Choose to use Margins or not (all generated have a default margin using the line-height)
6. Write some text to use your headings and paragraphs. There is an example using ATX headings in the markdown. To write ATX headings make sure there is a newline to write new stuff. I would advise writing the ATX headings elsewhere and copy and pasting it in.
 
7. Ideas? 
 
It would be great to build out a real markdown parser. That uses existing styles.
Generating the code in scss would be great but it is done well on other apps on the web. 
Using different vertical rhythm techniques would be a great option to throw in. 

This plugin is on github here. 
Feel free to use it, but the code lacks eloquence. 


I got this technique from Matej Latin’s book Better Web Typography for a Better Web
